### Weather Forecasting Project

This project leverages data science and visualization techniques to forecast weather conditions and present them in an interactive dashboard format using Power BI.
📁 Project Files
WeatherForcastingProject.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning model for weather prediction.
Wheather_Prediction_V4.pbix: Power BI report file with visualizations for weather data and prediction outputs.


🔍 Objectives
Build a model to predict future weather conditions based on historical weather data.
Clean and preprocess raw weather data to ensure accuracy.
Train and evaluate machine learning models for forecasting.
Visualize trends, predictions, and insights in a user-friendly Power BI dashboard.


🧪 Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.)

Jupyter Notebook
Power BI for reporting and dashboarding

⚙️ Features
